## About Docker Compose

Compose is a tool for defining and running multi-container Docker applications. With Compose, you use a Compose file to configure your application's services. Then, using a single command, you create and start all the services from your configuration. To learn more about all the features of Compose see the list of features.

Compose is great for development, testing, and staging environments, as well as CI workflows. You can learn more about each case in Common Use Cases.

Using Compose is basically a three-step process.

1. Define your app's environment with a Dockerfile so it can be reproduced anywhere.
2. Define the services that make up your app in docker-compose.yml so they can be run together in an isolated environment.
3. Lastly, run docker-compose up and Compose will start and run your entire app.

Compose has commands for managing the whole lifecycle of your application:

- Start, stop and rebuild services
- View the status of running services
- Stream the log output of running services
- Run a one-off command on a service

### Installation and documentation

- Full documentation is available on [Docker's website](https://docs.docker.com/compose/).

## About Laravel

Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable and creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Laravel takes the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in many web projects, such as:

- [Simple, fast routing engine](https://laravel.com/docs/routing).
- [Powerful dependency injection container](https://laravel.com/docs/container).
- Multiple back-ends for [session](https://laravel.com/docs/session) and [cache](https://laravel.com/docs/cache) storage.
- Expressive, intuitive [database ORM](https://laravel.com/docs/eloquent).
- Database agnostic [schema migrations](https://laravel.com/docs/migrations).
- [Robust background job processing](https://laravel.com/docs/queues).
- [Real-time event broadcasting](https://laravel.com/docs/broadcasting).

Laravel is accessible, powerful, and provides tools required for large, robust applications.
